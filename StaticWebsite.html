            <p>Naveen Tayyebi is a studious and creative student who always aims to discover and contribute
              scientific innovations, work with research groups, and collaborate with collegues on community
              projects to impact society. With a specific focus in pure mathematics and aerospace engineering,
              Naveen has spent the last seven years setting his project and learning goals far above class
              requirements to prepare himself for future academic research. Now that he is in college, he
              is seeking to transfer to a 4-year university, and is ready to put his skills to work.
              He has accumulated experience working in a robotics team, bicycle sales team, and postdoctoral
              research group, programming, has developed a strong background in mathematics and physics,
              and upholds a great work ethic.</p>
